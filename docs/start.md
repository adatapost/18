This work is an implementation of one of the promises I'd committed.  It is about the task that I was asked by community center members to design an application that defines day to day transactions, activities, and many other things related to and of the comunity members. It was winter 2016, three of the community center members visited me. and alsked my help. Recently, in Jan 2018, I met one of the person whom I met in winter 2016 and inquired about the project/software if finished so they can use at work. I was literally astonished because I have not started the work. In fact, I was expecting some input from them and I haven't got and also I did't ask them for.

I met one of those fellows on Jan, 10th 2018 and he asked about the software. So I decided to, I must develop an app to keep my promise, to myself and of course to my fellows.
