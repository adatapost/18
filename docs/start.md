It is about the task that I was appointed by my fellows to design an applicationto define day to day transactions, activities, and many other things related to the comunity members. It was winter 2016. Later, in Jan 2018, I got to meet one of them fellows and they inquired about the project/software if finished so they can use at work. I was literally astonished. That day, between 5 to 20 December of 2016, I met those fellow for 10 to 15 minutes and till end of 2017 they never spoke to me about the software and because that is the reason I left the idea to develop an app.

But, now, I must develop an app to keep a promise, to myself and of course to my fellows. I don't want to be remember as I'am actually.
